% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
\usepackage{amsfonts}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/

% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***

%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of

\section{Conclusion}
In this work we have defined an extension of the max pressure controller required for application on a real network of signalized traffic intersections. Given only the constraint that the network demands are serviceable in average, we have proven that updating a max pressure controller which allocates a fixed minimum proportion of service to each permissible phase at a slower rate than that which governs traffic flow will not destroy the stabilizing properties of the controller. 

%While there are additional modifications to the control model that must be addressed before max pressure can be considered a feasible algorithm for real-time operation of traffic signal controllers, 
Max pressure provides theoretical guarantees on network-wide performance that are lacking in other existing signal control algorithms. Our implementation in the referenced micro-simulation platform furthermore demonstrates how it could comply with the hardware and communications constraints commonly encountered in existing roadway infrastructure. These numerical simulations  reveal that an implementation of cycle-based max pressure competes with the existing standard feedback controller in many performance metrics, especially during periods of high congestion. It also appears to provide less variance in delays than the existing alternative. Future work will involve further analysis of the effect of cycle length on the performance of cycle-based max pressure, as well as performance improvements that can be achieved via the addition of common signal coordination practices in a network running cycle-based max pressure.
